# C printf() own implementation

The project mimics the real C printf function. It is written according to the 42 Programming School syntax and it might be that some parts might appear strange because of this.

This recreation of the native printf function was done using only my own library of functions and va_start, va_arg, va_copy, va_end. The library of C functions was created using only malloc, free, write functions.
